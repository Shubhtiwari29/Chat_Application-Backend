# Chat Application - Backend
This repository contains the backend implementation for a real-time chat application. Built using Java and Spring Boot, 
the application utilizes WebSocket for duplex communication between the client and server.

## Features
- **Real-time Communication**: Enables real-time messaging using WebSocket.
- **Full-Duplex Communication**: Supports bidirectional data flow between client and server.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
- **Efficient Messaging**: Ensures quick delivery of messages between users.

  ## Architecture
The backend architecture follows a modular and layered design for better scalability and maintainability:
1. **Controller Layer**: Manages WebSocket endpoints and handles message requests.
2. **Service Layer**: Encapsulates business logic for message handling and processing.
3. **Data Layer**: Stores message history and user data (if applicable).
4. **WebSocket Configuration**: Configures WebSocket connections, including handshakes and message brokers.

## Tech Stack
- **Java 17**: Programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for backend development.
- **WebSocket**: Protocol for real-time communication.
- **Maven**: Dependency and project management.
- **Database**: [Specify the database used, e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, etc., if applicable].

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven installed
- [Database name and version] (if applicable)

## Sample WebSocket Message Flow
1. A client connects to the WebSocket endpoint: `ws://localhost:<PORT>/chat`.
2. The server establishes a persistent connection with the client.
3. Messages sent from the client are processed by the backend and forwarded to the intended recipient(s).
4. Both clients receive acknowledgments and messages in real time.

### Message format: JSON (example below)
{
  "sender": "user1",
  "receiver": "user2",
  "message": "Hello, World!"
}

### Server-to-Client Response
{
  "sender": "user1",
  "receiver": "user2",
  "message": "Hi, how are you?",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-12T10:00:00Z"
}
### Usage
- Send and receive real-time messages using WebSocket-compatible clients.
- Use tools like Postman or browser-based WebSocket debuggers to test communication.

## Additional Future Enhancements
- **Message Delivery Receipts**: Add read and delivery status for messages.
- **User Presence Status**: Show online/offline status for users.
- **Media Sharing**: Support image, video, and file sharing.
- **Message Encryption**: Implement end-to-end encryption for secure communication.
- **Push Notifications**: Integrate notifications for message alerts.
